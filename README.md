The Quotes App is designed for those who love to read and share inspiring quotes. This app allows users to browse through a vast collection of quotes sourced from an API, ensuring a fresh and diverse selection every time. Users can easily share their favorite quotes with friends and family, spreading inspiration and positivity.

One of the standout features of the Quotes App is the ability to save quotes to a personalized “Liked Quotes” list. If a user likes a quote, they can add it to their list, which is stored locally using an SQLite database. This ensures that their favorite quotes are always accessible, even offline.

The app’s user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate through different quotes and find the ones that resonate most. Whether you’re looking for motivation, wisdom, or just a bit of daily inspiration, the Quotes App has something for everyone.

To get started, simply download the app and begin exploring the world of quotes. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome to help us improve the app and make it even more enjoyable.
